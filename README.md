# Twitter Sentiment Analysis using Python

This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on tweets using Python. Sentiment analysis is the process of determining the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) expressed in a piece of text. By analyzing the sentiment of tweets, we can gain insights into public opinion, customer feedback, and other valuable information.


## Usage
1. Open the twitter_sentiment_analysis.ipynb notebook using Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.
2. Modify the parameters in the notebook according to your requirements. You can specify the keywords, the number of tweets to analyze, and the sentiment threshold.
3. Execute the notebook cells one by one.
4. The notebook will fetch tweets based on the provided keywords and perform sentiment analysis on them.
5. The sentiment analysis results will be displayed in the notebook, showing the sentiment score and the corresponding sentiment label (positive, negative, or neutral) for each tweet.
